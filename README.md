# Music_Recommendation_System

A Personalized music recommendation system that suggests tracks, albums, and playlists based on user preferences and listening history, enhancing the music discovery experience.
This project implements a music recommendation system using both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches. 
The recommendation system suggests songs to users based on their preferences and similarities between songs.

## Features:

* `Collaborative Filtering:` Recommends songs to users based on their similarity to other users or their interactions with songs.
* `Content-Based Filtering:` Recommends songs to users based on the features of the songs, such as genre, artist, or lyrics.
* `Jupyter Notebooks:` Implemented and documented in Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding and reproducibility.
* `Python Implementation:` Built using Python programming language, leveraging libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning and pandas for data manipulation.

* `collaborative_filtering.ipynb:` Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of collaborative filtering recommendation.
* `content_based_filtering.ipynb:` Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of content-based filtering recommendation.
